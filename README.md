# Text Generation Using LSTM

This project demonstrates text generation using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on the text data from the "Game of Thrones" series.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is `game_of_thrones.txt.zip`. It contains the text from the "Game of Thrones" series.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Muhamid786/Text-Generation-LSTM.git
    cd Text-Generation-LSTM
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage

1. Generate text:
    ```bash
    python TextGen_LSTM.py
    ```

## Project Structure
- `game_of_thrones.txt.zip`: The dataset file. //or any other zip file you have


## Acknowledgements

- The dataset is sourced from the "Game of Thrones" series.
- This project is inspired by various text generation tutorials and examples using LSTM networks.
